Hello, my name is Jorge, and I am at the beginning of my journey to become a cybersecurity professional. I am excited to dive deeper into learning and applying the eight domains of CISSP, using tools like SIEMs, and exploring how to automate security tasks. I have always enjoyed learning about anything related to computers, and when I hear stories about cybersecurity incidents, I feel inspired to one day be on the front lines, protecting the people and organizations I work for.
I believe my problem-solving skills will keep me motivated to tackle challenges and find solutions. I am persistent and don’t give up easily; when an issue arises, I commit fully to resolving it, even if it means learning new skills or taking on complex tasks. I am not afraid to dive in headfirst to get the job done.
Collaboration is something I value greatly, as I know that cybersecurity is a team effort. I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into simpler terms for others and am also able to communicate specifics and detailed observations when needed. Effective communication goes beyond explaining, though; it also involves listening. I am always open to others’ perspectives and ideas, as I believe that incorporating diverse inputs leads to stronger solutions.
Looking ahead in my cybersecurity journey, my goal is to be a defender of personal information, protecting people from threat actors who seek unauthorized access. I value privacy deeply and believe everyone deserves to feel secure online. I also hope to contribute to making the internet a safer place by working with frameworks like NIST CSF to secure my organization's systems.
In the future, I aim to play my part in creating a more secure digital world for everyone.
